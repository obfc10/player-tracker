# Player Tracker Debugging Results

## Issue Identified

The main issue preventing the application from running is that the database connection is being attempted at module initialization time, but the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not set. This causes the server to hang during startup.

## Root Cause

In `src/lib/db.ts`, the original code was:
1. Creating a Prisma client immediately on module import
2. Attempting to connect to the database with `prisma.$connect()`
3. Throwing an error if `DATABASE_URL` was missing

Since this happens during module initialization, it blocks the entire Next.js server from starting.

## Fix Applied

I've modified `src/lib/db.ts` to:
1. Return a proxy object when `DATABASE_URL` is missing instead of throwing immediately
2. Remove the automatic connection attempt on module import
3. Let database operations fail gracefully when attempted without a valid connection

This allows the server to start even without a database connection, and database-related errors will only occur when database operations are actually attempted.

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the issues:

1. **Set up the database connection**:
   - Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points to a valid PostgreSQL database
   - The current URL in the file appears to be a Neon database that may need authentication

2. **Generate Prisma client**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Push the database schema** (if database is available):
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Additional Debugging Tools Added

1. **Comprehensive logging** throughout the authentication and database systems
2. **Error tracking system** that captures all errors globally
3. **Debug dashboard** at `/debug` for system health monitoring
4. **System status component** showing real-time connection status
5. **Diagnostics script** (`npm run diagnose`) for system checks

## Current Status

- The server should now start successfully even without a database
- API endpoints that require database access will return errors until the database is configured
- The authentication system will not work without a valid database connection
- All debugging infrastructure is in place to help identify any remaining issues
