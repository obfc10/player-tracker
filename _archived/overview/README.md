# Overview - Archived Features

This directory contains the isolated Overview (Kingdom Overview) functionality that was removed from the main application.

## Archived Components

- `overview/page.tsx` - Kingdom Overview dashboard page with comprehensive analytics

## Features Removed

- **Kingdom Overview Dashboard**: Main analytics page showing kingdom-wide statistics
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Kingdom-level metrics and visualizations
- **Alliance Performance Charts**: Overview of alliance statistics
- **Power Distribution Analysis**: Kingdom power breakdown visualizations
- **Resource and Growth Analytics**: Kingdom-wide resource and growth trends

## Navigation Changes

- Removed "Overview" from dashboard navigation menu
- Changed default dashboard redirect from `/dashboard/overview` to `/dashboard/players`
- Updated upload success redirect from overview to players page
- Removed LayoutDashboard icon import

## Database Impact

No database changes - all underlying data remains available for other features.

## Restoration

To restore Overview functionality:

1. Move files back to their original locations:
   - `overview/` â†’ `src/app/dashboard/overview/`

2. Add back to dashboard navigation in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   { name: 'Overview', href: '/dashboard/overview', icon: LayoutDashboard }
   ```

3. Import LayoutDashboard icon in layout.tsx:
   ```typescript
   import { LayoutDashboard, ... } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

4. Add back header mapping:
   ```typescript
   if (pathname === '/dashboard/overview') return 'Kingdom Overview';
   ```

5. Update dashboard default redirect in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   redirect('/dashboard/overview');
   ```

6. Update upload success redirect in `src/app/dashboard/upload/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   router.push('/dashboard/overview');
   ```

## Note on Player Overview

This removal only affects the kingdom-wide Overview dashboard. Individual player overview components (`OverviewTab.tsx`) remain active as they serve a different purpose for player detail views.
